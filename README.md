# PasswordGenerator
Project title
Password Generator

Motivation
A project was assigned to me



Built with
Javascript
CSS
HTML


Problem and Solution
The project asked for me to build a password generator. 
My first thought was to write down all the variables i might use
This includes lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols, and numbers.
After, I wrote a function that asks the user how many characters they want in their password.
After, I asked the user to confirm what characters they wanted in their password.
I stored all the values to an array.
I randomized through the length of the array and returned the amount of characters the user chose.
The original code given to me helped print out the randomly generated characters.
